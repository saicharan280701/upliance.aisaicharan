**Upliance-AI-Assignment**

This assignment analyzes user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends to uncover actionable insights for enhancing user engagement and optimizing platform offerings.

**Objectives**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze datasets related to user behavior, cooking
preferences, and order trends. The analysis aims to:
 Clean and merge datasets (UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails) for consistency
and accuracy.
 Explore the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders to
understand user engagement and purchasing patterns.
 Identify the most popular dishes among users based on order trends.
 Analyze demographic factors influencing user behavior and cooking
preferences.
 Create visualizations to effectively communicate insights.
  Summarize findings and provide actionable business recommendations to
enhance user experience and optimize product offerings.

**Assignment Workflow**
1. Importing Libraries and Loading the Datasets
The project begins by importing essential libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Data from three datasets is loaded:

UserDetails
CookingSessions
OrderDetails
2. Cleaning and Standardizing
Columns are standardized to ensure consistent formatting across datasets.
Missing values are handled appropriately:
3. Merging Datasets
Datasets are merged using common keys (user_id and session_id) to create a unified dataset that provides a comprehensive view of user behavior, cooking habits, and order details.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis
Conversion Rate: Analyzed the percentage of cooking sessions that resulted in orders.
Dish Popularity: Identified the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes.
Demographic Factors:
Explored the influence of age and location on order behavior.
Analyzed the distribution of orders across different cities and age groups.
5. Visualizations
Visualizations were created to highlight key trends and insights:

Top 5 Popular Dishes: Bar chart showing the most frequently ordered dishes.
Orders by Age Group: Bar chart illustrating engagement across age groups.
6. Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, key insights were derived, and actionable recommendations were provided to optimize the platform’s offerings and improve user retention.
